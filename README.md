README

This repository contains the scripts used to generate isoform-cell counts matrices for the datasets analysed in the paper/ preprint titled 'Obstacles to Studying Alternative Splicing Using scRNA-seq'. Each branch corresponds to a different dataset and contains the complete scripts to reanalyse that dataset. You can execute ./wrapper.sh to re-do the analysis. Note you will need to generate the scRNA-seq counts matrix for E-MTAB-2600 using the E_MTAB-2600 branch in this repository for the final R script.
