# README

This repository contains the scripts used to generate isoform-cell counts matrices for the datasets analysed in the paper/ preprint titled 'Obstacles to Studying Alternative Splicing Using scRNA-seq'. Each branch corresponds to a different dataset and contains the complete scripts to reanalyse that dataset. You can execute ./wrapper.sh to re-do the analysis.
